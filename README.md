SUBJECT OUTLINE 
41054 Applied Mechanics and Design A 
Spring 2024 
Subject description 
The strength and stiffness of machine components are   essential for   safety   and   ensuring   machines   and   structures   meet   minimum design life criteria.   In this subject, students   gain fundamental   knowledge   and   skills   required   to   undertake basic design for strength and   stiffness of mechanical systems,   including:   conducting   external   load   analysis   by   drawing   free body diagrams and applying principles   of equilibrium;   calculating   internal   actions   (normal   and   shear forces, bending and torsional moments)   by drawing free   body   diagrams   and   applying   principles   of equilibrium;   selecting suitable   materials and calculating appropriate sizes by applying   principles   of   mechanics   of   materials,   e.g.   stress,   strain,   material properties, ductile yield; and, conducting experimental testing   to   verify   and   validate   theoretical   results. 

Subject learning objectives (SLOs) 
Upon successful completion of this subject students should be able to: 
1. Design simple machine structural components for strength and stiffness. (C.1) 
2. Analyse relatively simple machine structural components by applying fundamental engineering mechanics and mechanics of materials concepts. (D.1) 
3. Apply experimental and computational techniques to analyse simple mechanical components. (D.1)

Contribution to the development of graduate attributes 
Engineers Australia Stage 1 Competencies 
This subject contributes to the development of   the following   Engineers Australia Stage   1   Competencies:
.   1.1 Comprehensive, theory based understanding of the   underpinning   natural and   physical   sciences   and   the   engineering fundamentals applicable to the engineering discipline.


.   2.1 Application of established engineering methods to complex engineering   problem   solving.
.   2.2   Fluent application of engineering techniques,   tools and resources.

Teaching and learning strategies 
Students will learn how to design and analyse mechanical components through practice-based problem solving and associated laboratory/workshop activities. This will occur during on-campus classes with peers and with tutor 
guidance and during students’ self-study time. Online learning resources such as videos, notes, quizzes and challenges aim to enable students to flexibly access, learn and use the subject content. 
This subject consists of consistent learning and work throughout the semester. The learning environment will include 
(1) online learning materials, (2) weekly face-to-face tutorials, and (3) laboratory/workshop classes. 
Feedback and opportunities for reflection on content will be provided during tutorials where students are advised to actively participate in learning activities facilitated by the tutor. 
Online learning materials are to be completed to help students learn from participation in individual and collaborative in-class activities in tutorials and labs/workshops. 
Formative activities with immediate feedback will be used throughout the online learning modules to help students monitor their progress and understanding of content. 
Students will complete several assignments that include practice-based/authentic problem-solving tasks to demonstrate learning of concepts and skills. 
Students may also participate in laboratory/workshop classes and complete a design/laboratory report.

Assessment 
Students will be expected to complete weekly problem-solving tasks   during   the   session   to   demonstrate   being   on   track   with the learning of concepts   and   skills.
To   pass the subject, students   must at least meet   the   minimum   requirements   of the   Pass-level   assessment   tasks,
which take the form. of quizzes that consist of analysis and design   problems.   Detailed   assessment   criteria   and
examples will be   provided   in the Canvas subject site to   show   students what the   pass-level   and   higher-level   standards   look   like..
Students wishing to achieve   more than a   pass for this subject   must complete the   pass-level   problems   at   a   level   exceeding the   minimum requirements and/or complete a laboratory work   and   a   project.
